      <h1 class="display-4 mb-5">Hi, I'm Tarryn</h1>
      <p>
        And no I’m not Australian or a New Zealander. 
        My lovely accent is from South Africa and no I don’t take offense.
        I am a molecular biologist and I spend my time trying to figure out
        why a certain virus can kill some cancer cells and not others.
        In geek speak (science-anese) I currently specializes in cancer,
        oncolytic viral therapy and stem cell research.
        What I really want to do is step away from the bench and spend time
        translating science jargon so everyone can appreciate the amazing
        discoveries being made there!

        I have always been interested in the idea that viruses, normally the
        bad guys in any biological story, can be used to treat disease.
        During my Masters, I built a new virus that was designed to treat
        Hepatitis C. Once I finished that project, I was intrigued by the
        idea that naturally occurring viruses could be used to treat cancer.
        So I followed my passion all the way across the world to Canada where
        I started a PhD in this field.

        I started realizing how important science communication was when I
        first tried explaining my Masters work to my close family and friends.
        This was an evolving process as my Masters and PhD interests differed
        quite substantially which meant I was constantly explaining new fields,
        experiments and discoveries, all of which I was still learning about
        myself, to my parents and husband.

      <p>I believe we as scientists have a responsibility to help the public
        understand the current progress in science while keeping it accessible
        and easy to understand. This is what has driven my passion for reading
        and writing about science. I love transforming complicated scientific
        ideas into approachable and accurate conversations on science. Science
        should be accessible to everyone and I’m here to help with that!
      </p>
      <p>
        Once I finish my PhD, I want to transition into a career as a science
        writer for now I will keep practicing with my blog and freelance where
        I can.
